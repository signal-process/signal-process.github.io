    title: 'High-Performance and Low-Cost Array Signal Processing: Challenges and Trends in Emerging Radar Applications'
    abstract: High-angle resolution has been a holy-grail for automotive and industrial radar applications. The development of low-cost and high-performance solutions necessitates the design of efficient antenna arrays paired with suitable angle of arrival estimation algorithms. The design of sparse arrays and the associated recovery algorithms is a potential approach to address the above challenges. The first portion of the talk will present an overview of recent literature in the field and some open challenges that need to be addressed to make them practically viable solutions, with some examples. The second portion of the talk will present a recent trend which is the development of low-cost edge AI solutions for radar applications such as target classification, gesture recognition and Automotive in-cabin sensing.  In order to overcome the limited angle resolution of low-cost Radars, such solutions typically leverage the superior range and velocity resolution of radars along with an ML network with a low compute and memory foot-print.

    title: "Deep Learning for (Indoor) Radar Perception: Datasets, Benchmarks, and Algorithms"
    abstract: (Indoor) radar perception has seen rising interest thanks to the affordability of high-resolution imaging radar sensors and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliable performance under hazardous conditions like fire and smoke. Current radar perception pipelines often neglect distinctive radar characteristics, such as temporal and spatial consistency of objects and multi-view configurations. In this talk, we will provide an overview of the latest advances in deep learning for (indoor) radar perception from the perspectives of open datasets, public benchmarks, and state-of-the-art algorithms. We will also showcase our latest work on radar object detection, 2D/3D pose estimation, and instance segmentation, summarizing the findings from our latest publications in CVPR, ECCV, and NeurIPS.
