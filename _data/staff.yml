    title: 'High-Performance and Low-Cost Array Signal Processing: Challenges and Trends in Emerging Radar Applications'
    abstract: High-angle resolution has been a holy-grail for automotive and industrial radar applications. The development of low-cost and high-performance solutions necessitates the design of efficient antenna arrays paired with suitable angle of arrival estimation algorithms. The design of sparse arrays and the associated recovery algorithms is a potential approach to address the above challenges. The first portion of the talk will present an overview of recent literature in the field and some open challenges that need to be addressed to make them practically viable solutions, with some examples. The second portion of the talk will present a recent trend which is the development of low-cost edge AI solutions for radar applications such as target classification, gesture recognition and Automotive in-cabin sensing.  In order to overcome the limited angle resolution of low-cost Radars, such solutions typically leverage the superior range and velocity resolution of radars along with an ML network with a low compute and memory foot-print.

    bios:
          -  Sandeep Rao is with Texas Instruments(TI) where he leads an R&D group on mmWave signal processing. His research group works on identifying new applications for mmWave sensing and is actively involved in defining the next generation of TI mm-wave radar devices. He has a Masters from the University of Maryland and a Bachelors from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. He has 30 granted patent (and an additional 20+ pending), in the field of mmWave sensing and GPS.
          -  Rajan Narasimha holds a Bachelor's degree from IIT Bombay and a doctorate degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (2011). He works for Texas Instruments as a senior technologist in Kilby Labs, Dallas. His activities in TI have spanned signal processing system and algorithm definition as well as embedded implementation for a variety of areas at the PHY layer such as SerDes communication, smart audio amplifiers and embedded control. His recent work has focused on system design for photo-diode arrays and sparse arrays and algorithms for mmWave radar. He has over 10 papers published in refereed conferences and journals and 14 granted US patents.
