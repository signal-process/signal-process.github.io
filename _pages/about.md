International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), held by IEEE signal processing society annually, is the worldâ€™s premier conference focused on signal processing theory, methods, and its diverse applications. It features a comprehensive technical program that highlights the latest advancements in research and technology, drawing thousands of professionals from around the globe.

The **High-Performance and Low-Cost Array Signal Processing: New Theories and Best Practices in Emerging Applications** workshop is a satellite workshop associated with [ICASSP 2025](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/). This workshop aims to unite researchers, practitioners, and students engaged in array signal processing, providing a platform to exchange knowledge on emerging theories and best practices in the field.

Array signal processing has experienced widespread application in various domains, including communications, radar, sonar, seismic exploration, medical imaging, and radio astronomy. Over the past decade, significant strides have been made in this area. However, there is a widespread misalignment of theoretical research and practical needs, which mainly manifests itself in the reasonability of assumptions, computational limitations, and implementation feasibility. This workshop seeks to bridge this gap by fostering an exchange of ideas among individuals from diverse backgrounds, thereby promoting collaboration that leads to innovative solutions and practical advancements in this field.
