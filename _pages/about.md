Information and communications technology shows enormous needs of and poses unique challenges to the theoretical research of array signal processing. Seemingly opposite performance demands, such as finer resolution and fewer data, frequently arise in emerging applications ranging from integrated sensing and communication, autonomous vehicles, drone swarms, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring. Traditional array signal processing techniques fall short of these applications’ expectations on hardware and computational complexities, robustness to external interference and internal failures, and need for decentralized processing schemes. Nevertheless, the past decade has witnessed great advances in array signal processing. Regarding low-cost methodologies, sparse arrays can save hardware resources and increase the number of degrees-of-freedom by harnessing structural information contained in various signals. In super-resolution algorithm research, ideas from compressed sensing, approximation theory, and convex geometry have been utilized to obtain stable signal estimates from general sub-Nyquist samples. However, there is a widespread misalignment of theoretical research and practical needs, which mainly manifests itself in the reasonability of assumptions, computational limitations, and implementation feasibility. This workshop intends to fill this gap by bringing together people with different backgrounds to exchange ideas and facilitate fruitful collaborations on novel algorithms and theories deployable in practical applications.
